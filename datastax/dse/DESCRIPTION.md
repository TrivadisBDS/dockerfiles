# DataStax Enterprise on Docker

> **Note:** Not meant for production use. See [this whitepaper on DataStax.com][whitepaper] for details on setting up DSE and Docker in production.

The repository for this image is [available on GitHub][repo]. Please use that to open issues.

## Starting DSE

Start a DSE node in Cassandra mode:
```
docker run --name some-dse -d trivadisbds/dse:tag
```

The default command is to run `dse`, so the [usual flags][dse-start] are available as well. For example, to start a Search node just add the `-s` flag:
```
docker run --name some-dse -d trivadisbds/dse:tag -s
```

## Starting Related Tools

With a node running, use `docker exec` to run other tools. For example, the `nodetool status` command:
```
docker exec -it some-dse nodetool status
```

Or to connect with `cqlsh`:
```
docker exec -it some-dse cqlsh
```

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be set at runtime to override configuration. Setting the following values will override the corresponding settings in the `cassandra.yaml` configuration file:

 - **`LISTEN_ADDRESS`**: The IP address to listen for connections from other nodes. Defaults to the hostname's IP address.
 - **`BROADCAST_ADDRESS`**: The IP address to advertise to other nodes. Defaults to the same value as the `LISTEN_ADDRESS`.
 - **`RPC_ADDRESS`**: The IP address to listen for client/driver connections. Defaults to `0.0.0.0` (i.e. wildcard).
 - **`BROADCAST_RPC_ADDRESS`**: The IP address to advertise to clients/drivers. Defaults to the same value as the `BROADCAST_ADDRESS`.
 - **`SEEDS`**: The comma-delimited list of seed nodes for the cluster. Defaults to this node's `BROADCAST_ADDRESS` if not set and will only be set the first time the node is started.
 - **`START_RPC`**: Whether to start the Thrift RPC server. Will leave the default in the `cassandra.yaml` file if not set.
 - **`CLUSTER_NAME`**: The name of the cluster. Will leave the default in the `cassandra.yaml` file if not set.
 - **`NUM_TOKENS:`**: The number of tokens randomly assigned to this node. Will leave the default in the `cassandra.yaml` file if not set.

The configuration files for DSE (under `$install_dir/resources` in the tarball) are also exposed as a volume (see below).

## Volumes

The following volumes are created and can be mounted to the host system:

- **`/var/lib/cassandra`**: Data from Cassandra
- **`/var/lib/spark`**: Data from DSE Analytics w/ Spark
- **`/var/log/cassandra`**: Logs from Cassandra
- **`/var/log/spark`**: Logs from Spark
- **`/opt/dse/resources`**: Most configuration files including `cassandra.yaml`, `dse.yaml`, and more can be found here.

## Logging

You can view logs via Docker's container logs:

```
docker logs some-dse
```
